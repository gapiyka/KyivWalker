# Kyiv Walker

## Story

The name for this app was inspired by not so famous `SwiftWalker`.
German Inventor Karl von Drais is credited with developing the first bicycle. 
His machine, known as the "swiftwalker," hit the road in 1817. 
This early bicycle had no pedals, and its frame was a wooden beam. 
The device had two wooden wheels with iron rims and leather-covered tires.
As the name suggests, a rider walked on top of the bike with his feet leaving the ground during descents.
